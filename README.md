# From Data to ACTION! - Melawan Perubahan Iklim dengan Energi Bersih

## Overview
This project is a data-driven initiative aimed at raising awareness about climate change and the importance of transitioning to renewable energy. The poster highlights the severe impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels and species extinction, while emphasizing the role of clean energy in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from industry and agriculture.

## Key Messages
1. Impact of Climate Change: Rising temperatures contribute to sea level rise, loss of biodiversity, extreme weather events, and habitat destruction.
2. Role of Renewable Energy: Transitioning to solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy can significantly reduce carbon emissions.
3. Sustainable Practices: Advocates for energy efficiency, responsible consumption, and green policies to combat climate change.
4. Urgency of Action: Encourages individuals to accelerate the shift towards sustainability.

## Data & Analysis
1. Carbon Emissions: Visualizes the impact of fossil fuels on global CO2 levels.
2. Energy Consumption: Compares renewable vs. non-renewable energy usage across different countries.
3. Climate Impact Metrics: Shows correlations between emissions, temperature rise, and environmental consequences.
4. Realization Energy in Indonesia: Shows how the government of Indonesia mitigate global CO2 levels, including impact metrics.

## Call to Action
The poster urges individuals, policymakers, and organizations to take action by:
1. Reducing Carbon Footprint - Adopting sustainable transportation, energy-efficient appliances (such as solar panel), and mindful consumption.
2. Investing in Renewable Energy - Supporting clean energy initiatives.
